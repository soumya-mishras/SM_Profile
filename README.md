Hello! I'm a mixed-methods researcher with a Ph.D. in Education Policy and over five years of experience analyzing large-scale datasets to understand user behavior and drive policy decisions. My work involves a blend of quantitative analysis (using tools like STATA, Python, and SQL) and qualitative insights from user interviews and focus groups. I'm passionate about applying rigorous research methods to solve complex problems and am currently focusing on challenges in the UX research space. You'll find repositories here related to data analysis, research projects, and explorations in user experience.
