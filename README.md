Hi, I'm Soumya ðŸ‘‹
I'm a mixed-methods researcher with a Ph.D. in Education Policy and over five years of experience analyzing large-scale datasets to understand user behavior and drive policy decisions. I'm passionate about understanding the "why" behind user behavior. My background is in applying rigorous, data-driven methods to improve large-scale systems.
My work involves a blend of quantitative analysis (using tools like STATA, Python, and SQL) and qualitative insights from user interviews and focus groups. I'm passionate about applying rigorous research methods to solve complex problems and am currently focusing on challenges in the UX research space. You'll find repositories here related to data analysis, research projects, and explorations in user experience.
